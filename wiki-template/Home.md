## Introduction - Azul AI Search

Azul is a strategic board game created by Michael Kiesling and published in 2017. In Azul, players collect colored tiles and strategically place them on their personal game boards to earn points. The objective of the game is to accumulate the highest number of points, and in this project, we are tasked with implementing three different planning algorithms as players in the Azul game. The three algorithms we have selected are Heuristic Greedy Best First Search, Value Iteration, and Monte Carlo Search Tree.

To determine the most effective algorithm, we decided to test each algorithm by having all team members play against each other using these algorithms. The agent that performed the best in these internal matches was selected to represent our team in the final tournament. By conducting internal matches, we aimed to evaluate the performance of each algorithm and identify the most successful approach. This allowed us to choose the version of the agent that consistently outperformed the others and demonstrated superior gameplay strategies. The selected agent, which was deemed the strongest based on its performance in the internal matches, was then finalized and placed in the "myTeam" file to be used in the official tournament.

This is how the game looks like when played:
