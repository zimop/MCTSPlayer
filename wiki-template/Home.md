## Introduction - Azul AI Search

Azul is a strategy board game designed by Michael Kiesling, and published in 2017. In Azul, the players collect colored tiles and depending on where they place it, they accumulate points. The winner of the game is the player that has the highest points. 
In this Project, we are to choose 3 different Planning algorithms, which we will deploy into players of the Azul Game. For this task, we have chosen the 3 algorithms: Heuristic greedy Best First Search, Value Iteration, and Monte Carlo Search Tree

We decided to all have a go at all the algorithms, and choose the version that performed the best when playing against each other. The agent that performed the best was chosen to place in the myTeam file which would be used in the tournament.

This is how the game looks like when played:
